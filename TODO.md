# TODO

- Rename repo and `name` in `package.json` to include **eko** in the name (perhaps `eko-js-sdk` ?)
  - We want the github repo name to be consistent with the npm package we publish
- **CI/CD**
  - Implement using github workflow
  - Push to master should run tests, and if they pass, publish package to npm (using package.json's version)
